                    Why is this topic “digital habits of children” so important for parents?
                </h3>
                <p class="fs-5">
                    <span class="fs-3 fw-bold">I</span>n a society where usage of
                    digital applications and other technology is increasing quickly,
                    knowing how that usage impacts academic success is critical for the
                    future of the next generation and a question often asked by parents. 
                </p>
                <p class="fs-5">
                    It is interesting to note that although the media constantly
                    criticize and are skeptical about children’s usage of digital devices,
                    the usage continues to increase and in fact,
                    <a href="https://parentology.com/what-you-need-to-know-child-cell-phone-usage-statistics">
                    many parents provide digital devices to their children for their
                    reasons and hopes for positive impact. Thus, children’s digital
                    device usage continues to increase.</a><a href="#"><sup>1</sup></a>

                    Here are some <a href="https://www.sellcell.com/blog/kids-cell-phone-use-survey-2019/">key reasons</a><a href="#"><sup>2</sup></a> that parents let their children use digital 
                    devices: to keep children entertained so parents can get some break,
                    to obtain convenient means to communicate with children, to allow
                    children contact with their friends, but also, hoping for the
                    educational impact. 
                </p>
                <p class="fs-5">
                    Knowing the impact technology might have on our young people is
                    especially important since it is increasingly present in children’s
                    lives and they are using it for various activities that may or may
                    not have a positive impact. For example, only <a href="https://www.sellcell.com/blog/kids-cell-phone-use-survey-2019/">
                    20%</a><a href="#"><sup>3</sup></a> of mobile device
                    usage is for educational purposes, regardless of the fact parents
                    often give their child access to the mobile phone for that purpose.
                    They are mainly being used to play games and watch tv (McConomy, 2019).

                    How can we explore the impact of children's digital habits?
                </h3>
                <p class="fs-5">
                    To give more insight on this question, we dive into the PISA
                    academic performance dataset. <a href="https://www.oecd.org/pisa/">PISA</a><a href="#"><sup>4</sup></a> (Programme for International Student Assessment)
                    is designed by OECD to measure 15 year olds’ skills in Math, Science and Reading.
                    As PISA test students around the world at regular intervals and include
                    a large number of countries, we use this dataset as our point of measure for
                    academic success and we compare the results with Google and Apple app
                    store downloads, app usage data published by Statista, as well as another
                    OECD dataset with data on how much time children spend on the internet.
                </p>
                <p class="fs-5">
                    We will start our analysis by looking at the association between
                    academic performance and app usage since a large portion of internet
                    usage is through apps/mobile phones and can be accessed anywhere or
                    anytime someone has a data connection. Applications are also very
                    common for  young people to use in their daily life. For these reasons,
                    we have used the data of app usage as ​​pseudo of the tendency and
                    activities that people engage in for mobile phone usage.
                </p>
                <p class="fs-5">
                    Once we have determined if there is a significant correlation there,
                    we will take a step back and we will further explore this topic of
                    children’s digital habit from wider scope, also by investigating the
                    usage of the internet in general as well as different types of
                    internet activity and how this correlates to academic success.
                </p>
                <p class="fs-5">
                    After our analysis, we hope that parents everywhere will obtain
                    data driven insights and be a bit more at ease, and become able to
                    have neutral perception towards the general criticism in regards to
                    childrens’ digital habits based on real data.

                    Now that we have a general overview of the app usage and academic
                    performance across the world, it is time to dig into the question,
                    whether certain applications are having some impact on their
                    children’s academic performance, especially applications that are
                    downloaded the most. To this end, we take a look into the correlation
                    between the education and game apps usage and academic performance.

                    are using the internet more than 30 minutes daily. Furthermore,

                    To this end, groups like UNICEF are making their own research on
                    how to utilize digital spaces for maximum positive values on children
                    (UNICEFInnocenti, 2022). Although this is the case, parents should be
                    aware if possible of internet usage at school as this can negatively
                    impact academic scores.

                <p class="fs-5">
                    To give reason to the lower scores at both the lowest and highest
                    ends of the spectrum, we made educated assumptions based on scientific
                    articles, but please note this is only speculation for which further
                    research and analysis should be made. 
                </p>
                <p class="fs-5">
                    Initially we assumed that participants in the lower usage end of the
                    spectrum could be from lower-income families and may not have the same
                    resources as their classmates, which may still be the case for some countries.
                    However this may not necessarily be the case. One study has shown that
                    more than 90% of children in Flanders, Belgium has internet access at home
                    (Valcke et al., 2007), however, if we look at the data above for
                    Belgium we will see that students who do not use the internet or only
                    for a very short amount of time perform overall poorly. A follow-up
                    study was also performed showing that low internet usage is due to an
                    authoritarian parenting style rather than lack of access
                    (Valcke et al., 2010).
                </p>
                <p class="fs-5">
                    On the other hand, we do assume that the lower scores found in the
                    highest end of the spectrum may be contributed to internet addiction
                    as it impacts the motivation of students in regards to their academic
                    work (Demir et al., 2018). As nicely put by Hossain et al. (2019),
                    “Cell phones are undeniably convenient, helpful tools for study and can be a
                    hurtful source of distraction depending on the attitude and use
                    pattern of a student.”

                <p class="fs-5">
                    Now we have discovered that using the internet daily does not mean
                    extremely bad to children in terms of their academic performance.
                    Rather, children who use the internet to a moderate amount even tend
                    to score higher than the ones who use less or not at all.

                    But a question remains, how are young people using these 1-4 hours?
                    And how should they use this time in a way that can have a positive
                    or at the very least neutral impact on their academic performance?
                </p>
                <p class="fs-5">
                    We have explored this by looking at data for four categories of
                    Internet usage/activities provided by OECD and compared those
                    categories to PISA academic performance which can be seen in the

                        to play games compared to once or twice a week or almost everyday,
                        there are plenty of students who perform well including some top performers.
                        However, we do notice that when games are played everyday,
                        there is a lower number of top performers (550+) and no students
                        in the highest category. Once again, moderate usage seems to be
                        the key.

                    internet usage among 15-year-olds and academic success shows us that
                    using online social networks is linked to lower scores compared to
                    students who are not active on these networks, while students who play

                    new parents? Should you wait to give your kids access to computers? We
                    have explored this from two aspects, age of start using 1) computers
                    and 2) internet.

                    We see a pattern from the highlight chart above that when the
                    children start using computers at earlier age, their academic
                    performance tends to be high. Let’s look into a detailed distribution
                    based on a histogram:

                </div>
                <p class="fs-5">
                    From the histogram, we can see that for children who score mid-high
                    (i.e., above 500+), they tend to be using computers younger than 9
                    years old. Interestingly, for the high performing group of scores above
                    520, more than 40% started to use computers when they were 6 years
                    old or younger. 
                </p>
                <p class="fs-5">
                    Now we know the situation of the first use of computers, how about the age of first Internet use?

                <p class="fs-5">
                    From the histogram it is interesting to note that almost 80% of the children started using internet after 7 years old in the mid-high performing group. In comparison to computer usage, it seems the exposure of the internet seems to be a little bit slower among the mid-high group. 
                </p>
                <p class="fs-5">
                    Overall, some parents may have concerns whether it is good or not to let their children use digital devices from an early age. 
                </p>
                <p class="">
                    Although there may be various elements to take into account, based on the data, exposing children to computers at an early age will not necessarily lead to a negative impact on academic performance. On the contrary, early starters tend to have higher scores on average.

                <p class="fs-5">
                    We have been discovering a lot of data through visualizations. So,
                    what can we share as key insights?

                    Smartphone use vs Academic performance
                </h4>
                <p class="fs-5">
                    We explored the correlation between the PISA score and the app used as pseudo data to explore smartphone usage. As a result, we did not find a strong correlation between the academic performance and the app usage.
                </p>
                <h4 class="fs-2 fw-bold font-monospace">
                    Time spent on the Internet vs Academic performance
                </h4>
                <p class="fs-5">
                    Students who spent 1-4 hours per day on the internet out of school had a tendency to be in the mid-high performing group. Therefore, “moderate time” (i.e., less than 4 hours a day!) spending on the internet would not necessarily have a negative impact, actually, mid-high performers tend to engage with the internet daily.
                </p>
                <p class="fs-5">
                    However, It is interesting to note, there is a good likelihood that spending more than 4 hours daily on the internet or using mobile devices might not have a good impact on academic success. 
                </p>
                <p class="fs-5">
                    So the common conception for overusing the internet may be correct, however, only to a certain point. No internet usage is also negatively correlated to academic success. Students who use the internet for less than 1 hours a day tend to perform worse than students using the internet between 1-4 hours a day.

                <h4 class="fs-2 fw-bold font-monospace">
                    What do we know about the types of internet activities?
                </h4>
                <p class="fs-5">
                    We see that not all internet activities are the same. Some internet usage has no conclusive relationship to academic performance like playing games, while others show rather a positive relationship, like reading the news or browsing the internet for fun (e.g. Youtube). 
                </p>
                <p class="fs-5">
                    What is interesting to note here is that no matter whether children are investing the majority of their internet time for games, SNS, chatting online, searching something or reading news, these activities are not showing specific direction, whether the children tend to perform better or not academically. 
                </p>
                <p class="fs-5">
                    This may be a good sign that parents can perhaps become a little bit flexible and relieved, even if children are not necessarily engaged in some educational contents on the internet (which is quite the common case!).

                    Does children’s age matter in any way?
                </h4>
                <p class="fs-5">
                    In our investigation, we focused on children’s age of their first use of computers and the internet. 
                </p>
                <p class="fs-5">
                    We see from the data that early exposure to computers is not harmful to possible academic success. Rather, children with early exposure to computers tend to have high performance, and most of the mid-high performers have started to use digital tools before 9 years old.

                    Our conclusion from this analysis

                <p class="fs-5">
                    We see that engaging in moderate digital habits have a potential to support children having a good academic performance.

                <p class="fs-5">
                    On the other hand, it’s important to show a good example on how to use the internet for learning purposes, whether it be through youtube, games, or other digital outlets. We implore you to get involved with your kids and learn through mobile apps.
                </p>
                <p class="fs-5">
                    If we remain realistic, there is no clear answer for the questions we are asking. The usage of internet and mobile apps can have a positive impact as well as a negative, so we would like to conclude with a quote from Mollborn et al. (2020), “...good ways to negotiate the uncertainty of a new technology regime as a society may be to reduce pressures on parents to manage their children’s technology use alone, help parents make choices that make sense for their own families, and communicate effectively with young people about technology use.”

                <p class="fs-5">
                    The latest PISA scores, which is our determining data for educational success, were only most recently recorded in 2018. Since that point in time there have been other factors, like the Corona-virus pandemic that majorly impacted the use of technology in young people. We are not able to determine how this generation has adapted accordingly.  
                </p>
                <p class="fs-5">
                    Our data only represents 15 year olds. We do not have data on younger ages. Similar research focusing on this demographic would be very interesting for parents, our target audience.
